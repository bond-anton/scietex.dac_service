# Install the released package from PyPI. The image is a distribution channel of
# the same tagged source that was published, so it does not build from the local
# checkout.
# Then slim the venv: pip/setuptools/wheel are build-time only, and valkey-glide
# ships one _fast_response extension per supported interpreter (cp39..cp314,
# pypy) while only the running interpreter's is ever loaded.
#
# Bytecode is compiled here with unchecked-hash invalidation so the runtime
# stage never writes a .pyc: a hash-based pyc is validated against the source
# content, not its mtime, which is what makes the image safe on a read-only
# rootfs (the runtime layer cannot be relied on to remember source mtimes).
