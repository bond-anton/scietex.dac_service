"""Configuration models and YAML loader for the DAC service.

`DacServiceSettings` is the concrete constructor (L0) base and the validation
target of the framework's four-layer config merge:

* L0 — `DAC_SETTINGS_DEFAULTS`, the builtins of a default struct instance.
* L1 — the service-owned ``dac/dac.yml`` bootstrap patch (`read_dac_config`).
* L2 — the framework's ``config.yml`` snapshot from the last successful apply.
* L3 — the remote ``dac`` section of a desired-state envelope.

The layers are patch dicts merged field by field with the three-state rule: a
key absent from every layer inherits the value below, a key present with
``null`` clears it (so the L0 value resurfaces), and a key present with a value
sets it. The struct is kept deliberately thin: backend selection, pin routing,
and part geometry are validated by the HAL constructors in
`devices.build_dac`, so the YAML schema only constrains types and unknown
fields.

Per-channel sequences are deliberately out of scope for this file: ``reference``
is one scalar for the whole device (the HAL accepts a per-channel sequence, but
the config schema does not), and the HAL constructor's per-channel ``gain``,
``power_down``, ``channels``, and ``buffered`` keywords are not exposed at all.
Those knobs live on the task layer, where a channel index already exists.
`DacChannelSettings` rows only describe polling, not the HAL geometry.

Device entries are keyed by a **string** device id (``devices: {dac0: {...}}``),
not an integer. An id names a device in task payloads and telemetry, and a YAML
mapping key is a string anyway, so an ``int`` key would need silent coercion on
every hop. `dict[str, DacDeviceSettings]` decodes string keys verbatim and
round-trips through `msgspec.to_builtins` unchanged.

    ``type`` selects the HAL class through `devices.DAC_PARTS`. Every remaining
    field is optional and forwarded to that class only when set, so the backend
    keywords (``port``/``device`` SPI bus and chip-select) and the shared
    keywords (``reference``, ``label``, ``log_level``) can be mixed as the part
    and its transport require. ``None`` means "not configured": the constructor
    default applies.

    The trailing fields are part-specific: ``range``/``latch_pin`` for the
    current-output and latched parts, ``load_pin`` for the load-strobed voltage
    parts, and ``r_ab``/``grounded`` for the digital potentiometers. A part that
    does not accept one of them rejects it at build time; the schema stays
    uniform instead of growing 23 variants.

    ``strobe`` is deliberately absent: the HAL takes a driver object there,
    while a config entry can only carry YAML scalars. Parts that need a load
    line take ``load_pin`` (or ``latch_pin`` for AD420) as an integer GPIO pin
    instead.

    ``poll`` is service-level, not a HAL argument: it excludes a device from
    `devices.poll_plan` while keeping it addressable for on-demand writes and
    reads. ``poll_interval_ms`` is the period for a channel with no explicit
    `DacChannelSettings` row; an empty ``channels`` list samples every output
    the HAL part reports at that period.
